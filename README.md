# Peer-To-Peer-Group-Based-File-Sharing-System
- Built a P2P file sharing system where peers can upload and download
files from their groups. A peer can create an account, log in, create a
group, and join an existing group
- It is a multi-threaded system that enables uploading of files to other
peers and downloading of files from other peers simultaneously
- A piece selection algorithm is used for parallel downloading of different
chunks of a file from multiple peers and SHA-1 hash is used for
verification
